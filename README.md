# PRODUCT RECALL ANALYSIS IN EXCEL

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

A product recall is a process initiated by manufacturers or distributors to remove or correct products that violate laws administered by regulatory bodies. These recalls aim to protect public health and well-being from products that pose risks of injury, gross deception, or are otherwise defective. Manufacturers and distributors undertake recalls voluntarily, though the regulatory bodies can issue orders for recalls in rare cases where a voluntary recall is not initiated.

Recalls involve several key components, including the development of a recall strategy that considers factors like the severity of the health hazard, ease of identifying the product, and the degree to which the product's deficiency is apparent to consumers or users. The recalling firm is responsible for notifying its direct accounts about the recall, providing clear information about the product, the reason for the recall, and instructions on how to handle the recalled products.

This communication is crucial for ensuring that the product is properly disposed of or corrected to prevent further harm.

#### Consumers play a critical role in product recalls by responding to recall notifications and taking appropriate actions, such as returning or disposing of the recalled products.

### Dataset
The dataset contains recall records made by different manufacturers for the year 1994 through 2022.

We are working with 11 columns & 26590 rows of data.

### Tool
This project was completed in MS Excel only. From data import to data profiling, cleaning and transformation was all performed in Excel. Then after the dataset was analysed, visuals were created on the basis of those analysis and a dashboard was created with interactivity.

Different Excel tools that were utelised in this project:
- Power Query  : For data import, profiling, cleaning & transformation.
- Pivot Table  : For data summarization & aggregation and analysis.
- Pivot Chart  : For visualization.
